## Database MySQL:
- The database is designed on MySQL and hosted on Apache software.
- All of the connections and queries are in PHP code.
- There are different tables created in the database to store user, admin, and product data.
- Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) of the database:

- *One change in the ERD is that the product table is connected to the cart and users table.

The website is designed to be used in almost any online E-commerce business. <br/>
The overall design/UI is modern and aesthetic.<br/>
The website also has [Music Player](https://elfsight.com/) with some space songs. <br/>
The entire website is hosted on Localhost using Apache. Just Copy and paste all the files in the htdocs folder in the Xampp directory and start the Apache and SQL services and you are good to go.
